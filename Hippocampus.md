Here’s a complete, self-explaining proposal you can drop into a pitch deck or paper pre-read. It’s written to be readable by non-experts, with the math precise enough for reviewers.

# Title

**Stability-Safe Continual Learning Under Constraints via Closed-Loop Plasticity Control (Replay → Selective Inhibition → Consolidation)**

---

## 1) One-paragraph summary (for everyone)

We want an AI system that keeps learning new things **fast** without **forgetting** what it already knows, **without breaking** downstream consumers of its embeddings/logits, and **without** blowing **compute, memory, or privacy** budgets. We do this by **measuring plasticity in real time** and **actively controlling it** with a short “sleep” routine that (1) **replays** a tiny set of past examples, (2) applies **selective inhibition** to just-overheated parameters to prevent interference, and (3) **consolidates** persistent gains into a slow, stable store. This yields **bounded forgetting** and **bounded representation drift**—practical guarantees that capacity-only approaches (e.g., MoE) and passive regularizers do not provide.

---

## 2) Problem statement (what exactly we solve)

**Goal:** Learn from a non-stationary data stream while meeting four simultaneous requirements:

1. **Plasticity**: Adapt quickly to new data/tasks.
2. **Stability**: Retain performance on earlier tasks (low forgetting).
3. **Backward compatibility**: Keep **representation drift** small so existing integrations (search, ranking, AB tests) do not break.
4. **Operational constraints**: Obey **latency/compute**, **memory**, and **privacy** limits (e.g., tiny replay or DP-sanitized memory).

**Why current fixes fall short**

* **Lower learning rate** ⇒ preserves old, but slows new learning (poor plasticity).
* **Regularizers** (e.g., EWC/SI/MAS) ⇒ slow drift but don’t target **just-overheated** connections that cause interference *right now*.
* **Replay-only** ⇒ helps, but a few potentiated weights can still dominate and drift.
* **Mixture-of-Experts** ⇒ scales capacity and reduces interference by routing, but **does not** (i) measure/limit plasticity, (ii) cap **drift** for backward compatibility, or (iii) work within strict **memory/privacy** budgets with guarantees.

**Our framing (novel):**

> **Closed-loop stability-safe continual learning**: maximize adaptation speed **subject to** per-update caps on forgetting and representation drift, all under compute/memory/privacy budgets—by **measuring** plasticity/stability online and **controlling** them via a replay → selective-inhibition → consolidation schedule.

---

## 3) Intuition (layman’s view)

* **Replay** is revising previous chapters while reading a new one.
* **Selective inhibition** is a **cool-down**: gently dial down the exact circuits that just got too excited so they don’t bulldoze older memories.
* **Consolidation** is filing only persistent changes into long-term memory.
* **Closed-loop** means we **measure** “how plastic” the model is right now and adjust the dials automatically, rather than guessing hyperparameters.

---

## 4) Formalization (math, compact and precise)

### Data & losses

Tasks/domains arrive: $\mathcal{T}_1,\dots,\mathcal{T}_T$, data $(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}_t$. Model $f_\theta$ has parameters $\theta$ and internal embedding $z_\theta(x)$.

### Objective with stability penalty

$$
\min_{\theta_t}\; L_t(\theta_t)
\;+\; \lambda_{\text{stab}}\,\Phi\!\big(L_{\text{past}}(\theta_t)-L_{\text{past}}(\theta_{t-1})\big)
$$

* $L_t$: expected loss on current stream $\mathcal{D}_t$.
* $L_{\text{past}}$: loss on a tiny governance-approved memory or generator.
* $\Phi(x)=\max(0,x)$ penalizes **increases** (forgetting) only.

**Optional hard constraint (per task $i<t$)**

$$
L_i(\theta_t)-L_i(\theta_i^\star)\le \varepsilon_i
\quad \text{(forgetting cap)}
$$

### Backward-compatibility constraint (drift cap)

$$
D_{\text{embed}}(\theta_t,\theta_{t-1};\mathcal{A})
=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}|}\sum_{x\in\mathcal{A}}\!\|z_{\theta_t}(x)-z_{\theta_{t-1}}(x)\|_2
\;\le\; \delta
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ is a fixed anchor set used by downstream consumers.

### Operational constraints

$$
\text{Compute}(\theta_t)\!\le\!C_{\max},\quad
\text{Mem}(\mathcal{M}_t)\!\le\!M_{\max},\quad
\epsilon_{\text{DP}}(\mathcal{M}_t)\!\le\!\epsilon_{\max}.
$$

## 5) Closed-loop plasticity control (the core mechanism)

We split $\theta=(\phi,\psi)$: **fast** weights $\phi$ (quick to change), **slow** weights $\psi$ (stable, consolidated). Each “macro-step” has a **wake** phase and a brief **sleep** phase.

### Signals we measure (to control the system)

* **Plasticity (current task)**

  * **AULC** (Area Under the Learning Curve) during first $K$ steps: $P_{\text{AULC}}$.
  * **Steps-to-target** (e.g., steps to reach 80% accuracy).
  * **Effective step size** $\eta^{\text{eff}}_t=\|\Delta\theta_t\|_2/\|\nabla_\theta L_t\|_2$.
  * Composite plasticity $\pi_t=\alpha_1 P_{\text{AULC}} + \alpha_2 \eta^{\text{eff}}_t - \alpha_3 \text{steps-to-}\tau$.

* **Stability/compatibility**

  * **Average forgetting** $\overline{F}$ across past tasks.
  * **Gradient interference** $\cos(g_{\text{new}},g_{\text{old}})$.
  * **Representation similarity** (CKA) vs. pre-update features.
  * **Embedding drift on anchors** $D_{\text{embed}}$.

### Control knobs (chosen each step or at “sleep”)

* $\lambda$: **replay strength** (SWR-like reactivation).
* $\mu$: **selective inhibition gain** (BARR-like targeted cool-down).
* $\rho$: **consolidation rate** (EMA fast→slow).

**Control law (one-line form)**

$$
u_t=(\lambda,\mu,\rho)
=\arg\min_u\Big[L_t(\theta_t;u)+\beta(\pi_t-\pi^\star)^2+\gamma\,\Phi(\text{Forget}_t-\varepsilon)\Big]
$$

subject to drift and budget constraints. Here, $\pi^\star$ is your target plasticity; $\varepsilon$ is the allowed per-update forgetting.

---

## 6) Why this works (first-order interference math)

Let $g_{\text{new}}=\nabla_\theta L_t$, $g_{\text{old}}=\nabla_\theta L_{\text{past}}$.

* **Forgetting arises** when $g_{\text{old}}^\top g_{\text{new}}<0$ (destructive interference):

  $$
  \Delta L_{\text{past}}\approx -\eta\, g_{\text{old}}^\top g_{\text{new}} > 0.
  $$

* **Replay** injects $+\lambda g_{\text{old}}$ so the step contains $+\lambda\|g_{\text{old}}\|^2$, offsetting harm.

* **Selective inhibition** damps coordinates with **recent high conflict** using a mask $M$ (EMA of per-parameter conflict):

  $$
  \tilde g_{\text{new}}=(I-\mu\,\mathrm{Diag}(M))\,g_{\text{new}}
  $$

  which **increases** $g_{\text{old}}^\top \tilde g_{\text{new}}$ by removing the most conflicting components—surgical, not global.

* **Consolidation** (EMA): $\psi\leftarrow(1-\rho)\psi+\rho\phi$, storing only **persistent** changes.

Together, the replay term aligns updates globally; inhibition removes local hot-spots; consolidation makes gains stick—**with measured plasticity controlling intensity**.

## 7) Algorithm (self-contained pseudocode)

```python
# θ = (φ fast, ψ slow); M = inhibition mask (same shape as φ); π* = target plasticity
for t in stream:
    # --- Wake (online) ---
    loss_new = L_current(φ, ψ; batch_t)
    g_new_φ, g_new_ψ = ∇_φ, ∇_ψ loss_new
    φ ← φ - η_f * g_new_φ
    ψ ← ψ - η_s * g_new_ψ                # η_f >> η_s

    # Measure plasticity & stability
    plasticity = AULC_recent() ⊕ steps_to_target() ⊕ eff_step_size()
    drift = embed_drift_on_anchors()
    forgetting = past_eval_delta()

    # --- Sleep trigger (periodic or when plasticity spikes) ---
    if trigger(plasticity, drift, forgetting):
        # 1) Replay (SWR-like)
        B_old = sample_memory_or_generator(k, priority="|grad|")
        loss_rep = L_current(φ, ψ; B_old)
        φ ← φ - η_f * λ * ∇_φ loss_rep
        ψ ← ψ - η_s * λ * ∇_ψ loss_rep

        # 2) Selective inhibition (BARR-like)
        # Build conflict scores c from signs/magnitudes of g_new vs. ∇ L_past
        c = conflict_scores(g_new_φ, ∇_φ L_past_estimate())
        M ← γ*M + (1-γ)*normalize(c)      # EMA smoothing
        φ ← φ - η_f * (μ * (M ⊙ φ))       # or shrink gradient: g_new := (I - μDiag(M))g_new

        # 3) Consolidation (fast → slow)
        ψ ← (1 - ρ)*ψ + ρ*φ

        # Closed-loop control: tune (λ, μ, ρ)
        (λ, μ, ρ) ← controller(plasticity, forgetting, drift, budgets)
```

## 8) What we will measure (metrics & diagnostics)

**Plasticity (current task)**

* AULC (first $K$ steps), steps-to-$\tau$, early-slope.

**Stability (past tasks)**

* Average forgetting $\overline{F}$; Backward/Forward Transfer (BWT/FWT); final Average Accuracy (AA).

**Compatibility (representations)**

* Embedding drift on anchors $D_{\text{embed}}\le\delta$; CKA heatmaps (layerwise).

**Interference diagnostics**

* Cosine$(g_{\text{new}}, g_{\text{old}})$ histograms; conflict energy $E^-=\sum_i \max(0,-g_{\text{new},i}g_{\text{old},i})$.

**Reliability & fairness**

* Calibration (ECE/Brier), macro-F1 or PR-AUC for class imbalance.

**Operational**

* Latency/step, sleep-block time, memory footprint, DP $\epsilon$.

**Statistics**

* 3–5 seeds, mean ± 95% CI; paired t-tests (or Wilcoxon) for $\overline{F}$, AA, AULC; report effect sizes.

---

## 9) Experimental plan

**Benchmarks (classification first)**

* Split MNIST (sanity), Split CIFAR-100 / miniImageNet (10 tasks), domain/rotation/permutation streams (controlled shift severity).

**Baselines**

1. **Replay-only** (no inhibition),
2. **Regularizer-only** (EWC/SI/MAS style on slow weights),
3. **Orthogonal gradient** (e.g., OWM/OGD-like),
4. **LwF** distillation,
5. **MoE** (capacity baseline),
6. **Ours**: Replay + Selective Inhibition + Consolidation + Closed-loop control.

**Ablations**

* No inhibition; no consolidation; fixed vs. adaptive $(\lambda,\mu,\rho)$; mask without EMA; different anchor sets.

**Hyperparameter ranges**

* $\lambda\in[0.1,1.0]$, $\mu\in[0.01,0.5]$, $\rho\in[0.001,0.05]$, mask EMA $\gamma\in[0.9,0.99]$.
* Trigger: plasticity MACD (fast EMA $\gamma_f=0.7$, slow EMA $\gamma_s=0.98$); fire if $p^{(f)}-p^{(s)}>\tau_p$ or drift $>\delta$.

**Compute budget example**

* Sleep block ≤ 10 ms, memory ≤ 32 MB, DP generator with $\epsilon\le 2$ if raw replay restricted.

**Primary figure set**

1. **Stability–Plasticity frontier** (AULC vs. $1-\overline{F}$): ours shifts up/right.
2. **Cosine histograms** pre/post sleep: mass moves toward ≥0.
3. **CKA heatmaps** across layers: lower drift with inhibition.
4. **Forgetting bars** (per task) and **AA** with 95% CI.
5. **Drift-vs-latency** trade curve under different controller settings.

## 10) Theoretical handles (sketches you can formalize)

* **Interference bound:** Show $\mathbb{E}[g_{\text{old}}^\top \tilde g_{\text{new}}]$ increases with a mask that emphasizes sign-conflict coordinates, giving a first-order guarantee of reduced forgetting.
* **Drift control:** Under Lipschitz features, a bound on the masked shrinkage implies an upper bound on expected embedding movement per update; with a consolidation EMA, cumulative drift is sublinear in steps for stationary segments.
* **Closed-loop stability:** With quadratic surrogate cost, the controller converges to a neighborhood of $\pi^\star$ while respecting inequality constraints via soft penalties.

---

## 11) Risks & mitigations

* **Mask mis-estimation** → damp wrong weights. *Mitigation:* EMA smoothing; confidence-thresholded masking; per-layer caps.
* **Sleep overhead** → latency spikes. *Mitigation:* micro-sleep every N micro-batches; amortize across idle CPU/GPU; cap replay batch.
* **Tiny/DP memory too weak** → use prototypes (coresets), synthetic replay (lightweight generator), or classwise BN stats.

---

## 12) Deliverables

* **Paper**: method, theory sketches, full metrics, ablations, Pareto/frontier figures.
* **Code**: PyTorch reference with logging for plasticity/stability/drift; config to reproduce all plots.
* **Artifacts**: anchor sets, seeds, and hyperparam grids; DP replay option.

---

## 13) Milestones (suggested 8–10 weeks)

* **W1–2**: Scaffold code; baselines; metrics; anchors & drift tooling.
* **W3–4**: Implement mask, inhibition, consolidation; closed-loop controller; sanity on Split MNIST.
* **W5–6**: CIFAR-100/miniImageNet streams; hyperparam sweeps; ablations.
* **W7**: Theory appendix (bounds), figure polishing.
* **W8–9**: Reliability/fairness metrics; DP replay variant.
* **W10**: Final results + paper draft.

## 14) Why this is novel (one line for the cover letter)

We convert continual learning from a passive, open-loop procedure into a **measured, closed-loop control problem** that simultaneously targets **high plasticity**, **bounded forgetting**, and **bounded representation drift** under **real-world budgets**, realized by a biologically-inspired **replay → selective-inhibition → consolidation** micro-routine.

### Appendix A — Minimal equations for the paper

**Plasticity index (per task $t$):**

$$
\mathrm{PI}_t=\lambda_1 \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K A_t^{(k)} \;-\; \lambda_2\,\text{steps-to-}\tau
\quad\ \text{(report mean ± CI over seeds)}
$$

**Forgetting (per task $t$)**

$$
F_t=\max_{u\ge t}A_t^{(u)}-A_t^{(T)},\quad \overline{F}=\frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}F_t.
$$

**Selective inhibition (mask update by EMA)**

$$
M\leftarrow \gamma M+(1-\gamma)\,\mathrm{normalize}\!\Big(|g_{\text{new}}|\cdot|g_{\text{old}}|\cdot\mathbf{1}[\text{sign conflict}]\Big).
$$

**Inhibited step (gradient-side)**

$$
\tilde g_{\text{new}}=(I-\mu\,\mathrm{Diag}(M))\,g_{\text{new}}.
$$

**Consolidation (EMA of fast→slow)**

$$
\psi\leftarrow (1-\rho)\psi+\rho\phi.
$$

If you’d like, I can convert this directly into a LaTeX “Proposal” section with figure placeholders and a clean symbols table, or spin up a tiny PyTorch scaffold that logs all the metrics above so you can start running experiments immediately.
